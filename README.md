# UnsecureIotLamp

Unsecure IoT lamp project based on a Raspberry Pi Pico W board.

DO NOT USE FOR PRODUCTION.

This code is a demo for a buffer overflow vulnerability that will cause a replacement of the MQTT broker.

This code is not at-all clean and is programmed so in order to demonstrate bad programming practices.

The Wifi constants, the MQTT server and the SMTP server have to be set in order to be operational.

This project is built using the Pico SDK v1.5.1
